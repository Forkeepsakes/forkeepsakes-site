      <h1>Acknowledgement</h1>
      <p>
        ForKeepSakes has always been more than wood and tools — it’s a reflection of family, memory, 
        and the spirit of moving forward. This space would not exist without the love, patience, and 
        encouragement of those who have walked beside me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every project carries their fingerprints in quiet ways: the lessons they taught, the laughter 
        we shared, the strength they gave when times were heavy. Their presence is felt in every cut 
        of wood, every joint fit together, and every story that gets told through what we create.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page stands as a simple thank you — to family, to friends, and to the community that 
        continues to inspire me. ForKeepSakes is not just mine; it belongs to every hand and every 
        heart that has helped shape it.
      </p>
      <p><em>Always Forward — Always ForKeepSakes — Always Family.</em></p>
